                Spoiler summary
            </h3>

            <p>"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" is the culmination of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy saga, where the fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance. The story picks up with Frodo and Sam continuing their perilous journey to Mount Doom, where they intend to destroy the One Ring and thwart Sauron's plans for dominion. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, and the remaining members of the Fellowship prepare for the final battle against Sauron's forces.</p>
            
            <p>As the armies of Gondor and Rohan gather to confront the dark lord's vast armies at the gates of Mordor, Aragorn embraces his destiny as the rightful king of Gondor and rallies the free peoples of Middle-earth to stand against the darkness. The battles that ensue are fierce and costly, with heroes such as Gandalf, Ã‰owyn, and Merry playing pivotal roles in the struggle.</p>

            <p>While Frodo and Sam face numerous trials on their journey, including betrayal by Gollum, they ultimately reach Mount Doom. In a moment of tremendous sacrifice, Frodo claims the Ring but succumbs to its power. However, Gollum intervenes, seizing the Ring and inadvertently destroying both himself and the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.</p>

            <p>With the destruction of the Ring, Sauron is vanquished, and his dominion over Middle-earth is ended. The realms of Men are saved, and peace is restored, albeit at great cost. The story concludes with the hobbits returning to the Shire, where they must confront the scourge of Saruman and rebuild their beloved homeland.</p>

            <p>"The Return of the King" is a tale of heroism, sacrifice, and the enduring power of friendship in the face of darkness, weaving together multiple narrative threads to deliver a satisfying conclusion to Tolkien's masterful epic.</p>
