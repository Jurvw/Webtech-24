            <h3>Early Reception</h3>
            <p>Soon after publishing it was already regarded by some as a masterpiece and a must read. Michael Straight called it: 'one of the few works of genius in modern literature. <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/136543/fantastic-world-professor-tolkien">For the whole review</a> </p>
            <p>But at the same time there was also push back against the books.
