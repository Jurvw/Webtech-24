            <h1>Early Reception</h1>
            <p>Soon after publishing it was already regarded by some as a masterpiece and a must read. Michael Straight called it: 'one of the few works of genius in modern literature'<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/136543/fantastic-world-professor-tolkien">For the whole review</a> </p>
            <p>But at the same time there was also push back against the books. There were those who found the books childish, the oversimplified divide between good and evil to be bad writing and the lack of interesting female characters to be disappointing. This hostility for the work of Tolkien continued well into the 21st century. This hasn't had an effect on the love for his work from the readers and is work has also been studied by scholars. <a href="http://jrrvf.com/sda/critiques/The_Nation.html">For more information</a>.</p>
